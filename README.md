The reposotory consists of 9 prediction models used for the stock close price prediction

The models were used to predict prices for 2 periods, pre COVID and post COVID for 30 companies from the Warsaw stock exchange as well as 4 indices
To predict the price the models used daily price range, trade volume, 30, 60, 120 day moving averages, 10 and 1 year polish tresury bonds, USD/PLN and EUR/PLN exchange rates, gold and oil prices as well as CBOE Volatility index.
The prediction simulated a real life scenario, predicting one day forward and readjusting the model with the noew observation.
To pick the best model specification hyperparameter tuning was used.
